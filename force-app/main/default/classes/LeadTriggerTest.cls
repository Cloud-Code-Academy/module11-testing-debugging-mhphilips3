/**
 * This class contains unit tests for validating the behavior of Apex classes
 * and triggers.
 *
 * Unit tests are class methods that verify whether a particular piece
 * of code is working properly. Unit test methods take no arguments,
 * commit no data to the database, and are flagged with the testMethod
 * keyword in the method definition.
 *
 * All test methods in an org are executed whenever Apex code is deployed
 * to a production org to confirm correctness, ensure code
 * coverage, and prevent regressions. All Apex classes are
 * required to have at least 75% code coverage in order to be deployed
 * to a production org. In addition, all triggers must have some code coverage.
 * 
 * The @isTest class annotation indicates this class only contains test
 * methods. Classes defined with the @isTest annotation do not count against
 * the org size limit for all Apex scripts.
 *
 * See the Apex Language Reference for more information about Testing and Code Coverage.

     * Test Method: testHandleTitleNormalization
     * 
     * Purpose:
     * This test verifies that the handleTitleNormalization method properly normalizes job titles 
     * based on specific criteria provided. The goal is to ensure that titles containing certain keywords 
     * are standardized and others remain unchanged.
     * 
     * Criteria for Normalization:
     * - If the title contains terms like 'vp', 'v.p.', or 'vice president', it should be changed to 'Vice President'.
     * - If the title contains terms like 'mgr', 'manage', or 'head of department', it should be changed to 'Manager'.
     * - If the title contains terms like 'exec', 'chief', or 'head', it should be changed to 'Executive'.
     * - If the title contains terms like 'assist', 'deputy', or 'jr', it should be changed to 'Assistant'.
     *
     * Test Scenarios:
     * 1. Positive Tests:
     *    - Titles containing the following terms should be normalized:
     *      - 'VP of Sales' -> 'Vice President'
     *      - 'Head of Department' -> 'Manager'
     *      - 'Chief Marketing Officer' -> 'Executive'
     *      - 'Deputy Manager' -> 'Assistant'
     *    - Assert that the title is changed correctly based on the keyword it contains.
     *
     * 2. Negative Tests:
     *    - Titles that do not contain any of the specified terms should remain unchanged:
     *      - 'Analyst', 'Consultant', 'Engineer', etc. should not be modified.
     *    - Assert that the title remains the same when no match is found.
     *
     * 3. Edge Case Tests:
     *    - Test for empty, null, or invalid title inputs to ensure they are handled without exceptions.
     *    - Test for case-insensitive matches (e.g., 'Vp', 'MANAGE', etc.) to ensure normalization works regardless of capitalization.
     *    - Test for extra spaces or special characters around the title (e.g., '   VP  ') to verify proper handling.
     *
     * Assertions:
     * - Positive tests should assert that the title is normalized to the expected value.
     * - Negative tests should assert that the title remains unchanged when no matching criteria are found.
     * - Edge cases should assert that no exceptions are thrown and proper handling occurs for null/empty titles.
